## Done is better than Perfection

Perfectionism means setting extremely high standards for yourself and ace in everything you are doing. You won’t stop until you are completely satisfied with your end results.

While it might sound cool to be a Mr. Perfectionist, but it often brings stress and self-criticism. Ever met someone who seems to ace everything? They might be perfectionists, but it's not all easy.

In my initial years, I have had really bad experiences when I optimized for perfection.

> I was working on a cloud project which was about developing a prototype using AWS APIs.
>
> I spent weeks writing and polishing my design docs, work on it till I feel everyone will like it. I made some assumptions and never asked if they were right. I wanted the first version of the doc to be perfect.
>
> This delayed project when the reviewers pointed out and got a constructive feedback that I should have flagged earlier and not waited this much



I know it is always a trade-off and we don’t want to move too fast and deliver a poor quality product. But now, my decision making frameworks mostly prefer progress over perfection.
