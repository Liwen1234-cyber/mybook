**Reimagining Success and Society**

How can we escape this meritocratic trap? Sandel challenges us to rethink three critical areas: education, the dignity of work, and the meaning of success.

1. Education:

   Sandel questions whether universities should be arbiters of opportunity. He proposes a radical solution: replacing the hypercompetitive admissions process with a lottery system for applicants who meet a basic threshold. This approach, he argues, would reduce elitism, relieve pressure on students, and acknowledge the role of luck in success.

2. Dignity of Work:

   We must redefine the value of work. As Martin Luther King Jr. once said, “All labor has dignity.” Society must recognize and reward contributions to the public good, not just economic profitability. The pandemic has reminded us of our reliance on often-overlooked workers; their dignity must be restored and celebrated.

3. Meaning of Success:

   Sandel urges us to confront the moral arbitrariness of success. Much of what determines achievement—talent, opportunity, even ambition—is shaped by circumstances beyond our control. Recognizing this fosters humility, gratitude, and a sense of shared responsibility for one another.

**Conclusion: Toward a More Inclusive Public Life**

Ladies and gentlemen, the meritocratic ideal has lost its way. To rebuild a society that is fair, inclusive, and humane, we must balance individual achievement with a renewed commitment to the common good.

Sandel reminds us that true success lies not in outcompeting others but in contributing to the well-being of our communities. It is a call for less arrogance, more humility, and a collective reimagination of what it means to live together.

Let us seize this moment to transcend the tyranny of merit and embrace a future defined by dignity, solidarity, and shared purpose. Thank you.
