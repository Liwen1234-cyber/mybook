**How Can We Move Beyond the Meritocracy?**

Let’s rethink meritocracy and how it shapes our lives. Michael Sandel challenges us to move beyond the idea that success is purely earned through hard work.

**Rethinking Education**

First, education shouldn’t be a race for elite degrees. What if university admissions used a lottery for qualified candidates? It would reduce pressure, curb arrogance, and remind us that everyone’s contributions matter—not just those with fancy diplomas.

**Valuing All Work**

Next, let’s talk about work. The pandemic showed us that delivery drivers, nurses, and grocery clerks are just as vital as CEOs. Yet, we often overlook them. We need to respect and reward all work—not just high-paying jobs—because every role contributes to the common good.

**Redefining Success**

Lastly, success isn’t just about talent and effort. Luck and opportunity play a huge role. Recognizing this should make us more humble and focus less on personal gain, more on building a fair and connected society.
So, let’s aim for less arrogance, more respect. A society where everyone feels valued—not just for what they achieve, but for who they are.

Thank you!



**Breaking Free from the Tyranny of Merit**

Meritocracy seems fair: work hard, and you succeed. But as Michael Sandel points out, it often leads to arrogance at the top and despair at the bottom. Let’s explore how we can move beyond it.

**Rethinking Education**

Education is a major driver of meritocracy. Elite universities often feel like gates to success, creating immense pressure. Imagine if qualified candidates entered by lottery. It would reduce stress, make admissions fairer, and remind us that success isn’t the only measure of a person’s worth.

**Valuing All Contributions**

Think about the pandemic. Delivery drivers, nurses, and grocery clerks kept us going while CEOs worked remotely. But do we reward them fairly? A just society must recognize that all work has value, not just jobs with high salaries or prestige.

**Redefining Success**

Finally, let’s redefine success. Talent and hard work matter, but so do luck and opportunity. Realizing this makes us more humble and empathetic. Instead of just climbing our personal ladders, we should focus on building a more inclusive society.

By rethinking education, valuing all work, and redefining success, we can move toward a society where everyone feels respected—not for what they achieve, but for the role they play.

Thank you!
