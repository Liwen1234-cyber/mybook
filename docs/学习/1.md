**How Can We Move Beyond the Meritocracy?**

Let’s rethink meritocracy and how it shapes our lives. Michael Sandel challenges us to move beyond the idea that success is purely earned through hard work.

**Rethinking Education**

First, education shouldn’t be a race for elite degrees. What if university admissions used a lottery for qualified candidates? It would reduce pressure, curb arrogance, and remind us that everyone’s contributions matter—not just those with fancy diplomas.

**Valuing All Work**

Next, let’s talk about work. The pandemic showed us that delivery drivers, nurses, and grocery clerks are just as vital as CEOs. Yet, we often overlook them. We need to respect and reward all work—not just high-paying jobs—because every role contributes to the common good.

**Redefining Success**

Lastly, success isn’t just about talent and effort. Luck and opportunity play a huge role. Recognizing this should make us more humble and focus less on personal gain, more on building a fair and connected society.
So, let’s aim for less arrogance, more respect. A society where everyone feels valued—not just for what they achieve, but for who they are.
